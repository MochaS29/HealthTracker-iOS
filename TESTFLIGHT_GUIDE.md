## Step 3: Prepare Build for Upload

### Option A: Using the Script (Recommended)

Run the provided script:

cd /Users/mocha/Development/iOS-Apps/HealthTracker
./prepare-for-testflight.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Process in Xcode

1. **Update Version and Build Number**:
   - Open project in Xcode
   - Select HealthTracker target
   - General tab > Identity section
   - Version: 1.0.0 (or your version)
   - Build: Increment for each upload

2. **Select Generic iOS Device**:
   - In Xcode toolbar, change from simulator to "Any iOS Device (arm64)"

3. **Create Archive**:
   - Menu: Product > Archive
   - Wait for build to complete

4. **Upload to App Store Connect**:
   - Window > Organizer opens automatically
   - Select your archive
   - Click "Distribute App"
   - Choose "App Store Connect"
   - Select "Upload"
   - Follow the prompts

## Step 4: Configure TestFlight

After upload (processing takes 10-30 minutes):

1. **Internal Testing**:
   - Automatically available to your team
   - No review required
   - Add testers by email

2. **External Testing**:
   - Requires brief review (usually 24-48 hours)
   - Can have up to 10,000 testers
   - Create groups for different test focuses

3. **Add Test Information**:
   ```
   What to Test:
   - Food tracking and meal planning
   - Exercise logging
   - Supplement tracking
   - Weight tracking
   - HealthKit integration
   - Recipe browser and meal plans

   Test Account (if needed):
   - No account required
   ```

## Step 5: Invite Testers

### For Internal Testing:
1. Go to TestFlight tab
2. Select "Internal Group"
3. Add testers by email
4. They'll receive TestFlight invitation immediately

### For External Testing:
1. Create a new group or use existing
2. Add tester emails
3. Submit for review (first time only)
4. Once approved, invitations sent

## Important Considerations

### HealthKit Requirements:
- âœ… Privacy policy URL required
- âœ… Clear usage descriptions in Info.plist
- âœ… Only request necessary health data types
- âœ… Handle authorization properly

### TestFlight Limits:
- Build expires after 90 days
- Maximum 100 internal testers
- Maximum 10,000 external testers
- New builds can be added without re-review

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **"Missing Compliance" Error**:
   - In App Store Connect, answer export compliance questions
   - For HealthTracker: Usually "No" to encryption questions

2. **Archive Not Showing in Organizer**:
   - Ensure you're building for "Any iOS Device"
   - Check that scheme is set to Release configuration

3. **Upload Fails**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify App Store Connect agreements are signed
   - Ensure bundle ID matches App Store Connect

4. **HealthKit Not Working**:
   - Verify entitlements are properly configured
   - Check Info.plist has usage descriptions
   - Ensure capabilities are enabled in Xcode
