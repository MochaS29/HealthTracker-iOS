# Branch Management Strategy

## 🔒 Current Setup

### Branches:
- **`main`** - Production branch (protected)
- **`release/1.0.0`** - App Store v1.0.0 (frozen for release)
- **`develop`** - Active development for new features ← YOU ARE HERE

### Tags:
- **`v1.0.0`** - App Store release version

## 📱 Your App Store Version is SAFE!

Your release version is locked in:
- Branch: `release/1.0.0`
- Tag: `v1.0.0`
- This code won't change no matter what you do in `develop`

## 🚀 How to Work Safely

### For NEW Features (Current):
```bash
# You're already on develop branch
git status  # Should show: On branch develop

# Work freely - add new features
# Edit files, add features, experiment

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature X"

# Your App Store version is untouched!
```

### If You Need App Store Bug Fixes:
```bash
# Switch to release branch
git checkout release/1.0.0

# Fix the bug
# Edit files...

# Commit the fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Issue with Y"

# Tag new release
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Bug fix release"

# Go back to development
git checkout develop

# Merge the fix into develop too
git merge release/1.0.0
```

## 📋 Branch Workflow

```
main (production)
  ↓
release/1.0.0 (App Store) ← LOCKED VERSION
  ↓
develop (new features) ← YOUR WORK HERE
  ↓
feature/xyz (optional feature branches)
```

## 🔧 Common Commands

### Check Current Branch:
```bash
git branch
```

### Switch to Release (for App Store builds):
```bash
git checkout release/1.0.0
```

### Switch to Development:
```bash
git checkout develop
```

### See All Changes Since Release:
```bash
git diff release/1.0.0..develop
```

## 🏗️ Safe Development Workflow

### 1. Always Check Your Branch First:
```bash
git branch  # Should show * develop
```

### 2. For New Features:
- Work in `develop` branch
- Test thoroughly
- Don't worry about breaking release version

### 3. For App Store Updates:
- Switch to `release/1.0.0`
- Build and archive from this branch
- Upload to TestFlight/App Store

### 4. Version Numbers:
- **Release Branch**: 1.0.0, 1.0.1 (bug fixes)
- **Develop Branch**: 1.1.0, 1.2.0 (new features)

## 📱 Building for App Store

### Always Build Release Version:
```bash
# Switch to release branch
git checkout release/1.0.0

# Open Xcode
open HealthTracker.xcodeproj

# Archive and upload
# This uses your locked, tested code!
```

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ **App Store Version**: Safe in `release/1.0.0`
- ✅ **Development Version**: Active in `develop`
- ✅ **You can't break the release** by working in develop

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Before App Store submission**, always:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/1.0.0
   ```

2. **For daily development**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```

3. **See version in Xcode**:
   - The branch name shows in Source Control navigator

4. **Emergency App Store fix**:
   - Use `release/1.0.0` branch
   - Make minimal changes
   - Tag as v1.0.1, v1.0.2, etc.

## 🚦 Branch Status Indicators

- **`release/*`** = 🔒 Stable, tested, App Store ready
- **`develop`** = 🚧 Active development, may have bugs
- **`feature/*`** = 🧪 Experimental features

## 📅 Release Schedule Suggestion

1. **v1.0.0** - Current App Store release
2. **v1.1.0** - Next feature release (from develop)
   - New features you're building now
   - Target: 2-4 weeks after v1.0.0
3. **v1.0.1** - Hot fixes if needed (from release/1.0.0)

---

**Remember**: Your App Store version (v1.0.0) is completely safe in its own branch.
You can experiment freely in `develop` without any risk! 🎉
